# msgbot backend
chatbot template project for msg public sector demo bot
- You will need to install Python 3.x. Latest is 3.7 - get it here
https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need an IDE for Python. I recommend Pycharm Community. Get it here:

The install.bat script creates a python venv and installs all of the necessary libraries to get started with chatbot development with RASA. 
You can call the bat or recreate the steps manually if you wish.
